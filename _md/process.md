# How we Made This and What it is

## Research
We Talked to archaeologist Amber Arnold. We also used websites and videos. Our main ones were PBS News, COST, and Interner Archaeologist

## Problem
Our problem we found after research and talking to Amber has 2 parts. 1, old storage medias are deteriorating with important archaeologist data on them.
2, data on those storage medias can't be broadly shared or searched.
Would you want to search through piles of notebooks or search in a search box?

### Numbers
Through the last 2 centuries it is estimated that over half of archaeologist records have been lost

Right now there is over 5 petabytes of archaeologist records not on a database, that is over 40,000 avrage phones worth

Most of archaeologist records have been on paper, hared drives, and floppy disks

Floppy disks can only hold 1.44mb which is less than a average photp

Floppy disks and hard drives only last 10-20 years under ideal conditions

## Solution
The important part of our solution is getting data off decaying drives and onto the cloud. The cloud is a safe and maintained home for important data.

### Some things to watch out for
Ethical and legal constraints
CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics)
PII (personal identifying infomation)

## Plan
This is our flowchart:
